# collate
_Collate_ is an open-source alternative to (_tModLoader_)[https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader]'s **ModCompile** system, which enables users to develop and compile their mods in a development environment.

_Collate_ is developed with the goal of expanding the functionality of the environment, providing both many useful new features and helpful quality-of-life improvements to help speed up development.

## Features
_Collate_ is still being developed. See all planned features [here](PLANNED.md).
